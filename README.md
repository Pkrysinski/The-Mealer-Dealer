The create a meal button takes them to the build your meal page, and they enter the following criteria: Total Time, Quanity of Meals, Quantity of People and Choose a Protein. When they submit the form, they will see all the results that match that their input. When they click on the recipe, they will then find ingredients and instructions for that meal.

If the user clicks on view all meals, they are presented with all meals. If the user wants to mark a meal as cooked, they simply toggle the cooked checkbox. When meals are marked as cooked, they will show up in the view past meals section.
